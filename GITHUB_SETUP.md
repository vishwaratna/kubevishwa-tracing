# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" or the "+" icon
3. Repository name: `kubevishwa-tracing`
4. Description: `Kubernetes-native distributed tracing solution with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger`
5. Set to Public or Private as desired
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kubevishwa-tracing.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify Setup
After pushing, you should see all your files on GitHub at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kubevishwa-tracing

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/kubevishwa-tracing.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Repository Status
